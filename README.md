CPPUtilityLibrary is an object-oriented (OOP) C++ library that provides a collection of the most commonly used functions in programming. It allows developers to reuse essential functions instead of rewriting them from scratch.

The library is organized into classes, each grouping related functions, such as mathematical operations, string processing, file handling, and array manipulation, making it more structured and scalable.
